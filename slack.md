Hello Juniors,

I am here to share about the work I had done during Aparoksha'19 and how I came up with a solution to skip the manual work and automate it with a script(code).I might be too long. But at the end you will have some cool resources to automate things(you can use them to irritate your friends).

I was one of the Volunteer in the Campus Ambassador Program. We were told to add 1100 people in 5 WhatsApp groups for better interaction with Campus Ambassadors of various colleges.
After that we were told to send offer letter to selected candidates in the form of
 `.pdf`(PDF) format.
For that we had to edit a word document, edit their name in the `.doc`  file after convert that file in to `.pdf` format and mail the PDF file to their email address.

We did all that work manually and it took 5 hours for each of us(3 people) to send offer letters to all the selected candidates.
Later I thought that all the work(manual) can be automated as it was repeated work and there is nothing to think to do that work.

After that in summer holidays I came to know that we can send any file any number of times through email with just "15 lines" of code and of course internet connection is also required.
As we might have observed we can save `.doc` or `.docx` file in MS Word as `.pdf` file then there must be some code that could convert `.doc` or `.docx` file to `.pdf` file. 

I googled how to convert a `.doc` file or `.docx` file to `.pdf` file.
I found a python library which helps me.

Then I thought, should I provide the program with name manually(then again it becomes manual work).
I came across another python library in the documentation i.e.,`csv`library, which can help in handling `.csv`(comma separated value) files.

I was done in searching with all the tools required for me to finish my work.

I made a `.csv` file with all the names of the people I had to send 
the letters.

Now it was time for me to start writing the code.
I wrote python code to read that `.csv` file.
After getting name and mail ID I edited the `.doc` file and converted that file 
into `.pdf` format. After getting my offer letter ready
in `.pdf` format I mailed it using the code I wrote to send 
any file to a particular(whatever we wish to) mail address.

BOOM! using this I reduced the manual work we did to send offer letters to 500 people which takes 15 hours for a man to complete to just 15 minutes time for the code to completely execute.
