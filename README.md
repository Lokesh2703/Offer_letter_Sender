# Offer_letter_Sender
This project is made for automating some manual work I have done for sending certificates to each and everyone after editing their name.

Follow the instructions below to use:

First of all clone the project
`git clone "https://github.com/Lokesh2703/Offer_letter_Sender.git"`


Run the following command to get requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`



Edit the `names.csv` file with the names and Emails required or Add the csv file into this folder with filename as `names.csv`
"*.csv" file must have two columns with first column-names and second column-Email addresses



Run the program:
`python Offer_letter_sender3.py`

Now relax and see the results.
